# leocc

Leo's C compiler.
This compiler emits 64-bit Windows executables in the Portable Executable (PE) format for the x86-64 architecture.

`leocc` supports all the major C language features, including variables and the main function.
If `leocc` fails, it is probably because you are using obscure or invalid C syntax.

## Quickstart

```sh
docker run kostaleonard/leocc
```
